## Setup the custom rule

Make sure you have `AWS CLI` profile configured before executing below commands

```sh
dir_name="kon"
custom_rule_name="monitor_unused_iam_roles"

# If you dont have venv installed already
# pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv ${dir_name}
cd ${dir_name}
source bin/activate
pip3 install rdk
# Configure AWS Profile
rdk init
# Lets create a LOCAL rule
rdk create ${custom_rule_name} --runtime python3.7 --resource-types AWS::IAM::Role

# Copy the file from `lambda_src` to the directory ${custom_rule_name} that was created now

# Deploy the custom rule
rdk deploy ${custom_rule_name}
```
